RFID Based Inventory Management System

## Introductions
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track objects via tags. Unlike traditional barcodes, RFID does not require direct line-of-sight and can process multiple items simultaneously, making it highly efficient.
RFID has been widely implemented in various industries such as retail, healthcare, and logistics. It is used for inventory tracking, patient identification, and electronic toll systems, among others. The adoption of long-range high-frequency RFID systems operating at 13.56 MHz enables tracking over significant distances, making them ideal for real-time inventory management.
This project develops a cost-effective inventory management system using an Impinj RFID reader. By integrating IoT technology, the system automates item tracking and monitoring. A web-based interface built with Laravel and MySQL allows users to manage inventory and generate reports efficiently.

## Use Cases
For this project, we are simulating a clothing store equipped with RFID technology that can automate inventory tracking by dividing the store into zones such as "Entrance," "Men’s Clothing," "Women’s Clothing," and "Fitting Room." RFID antenna readers placed in each zone track item movement and send real-time data to the cloud, enabling staff to monitor item locations through a web interface. This system enhances efficiency, provides instant inventory visibility, and allows staff and customers to retrieve information quickly, improving the overall shopping experience. We are using AUT3, which operates in the ISM band (2.4–5.8 GHz) and is ideal for RFID systems. It has a gain of 3.5 dBi, an omni-directional radiation pattern for full coverage across all store zones, and right-hand circular polarization (R-CP) to ensure reliable tag detection even when tags are misaligned. These features make it a perfect choice for our inventory tracking system. This system enhances efficiency, provides instant inventory visibility, and allows staff and customers to retrieve information quickly, improving the overall shopping experience.
